# Language-Related Hardware VLSI Project 🚀

This repository explores the integration of **speech and text processing** for **hardware-based language applications**. The end goal is to prototype SoC-level language interface blocks that can be used for multilingual voice or handwritten input for devices like smart assistants, translation engines, etc.
