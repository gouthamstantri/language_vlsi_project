# Language-Related Hardware VLSI Project 🚀

This repository explores the integration of **speech and text processing** for **hardware-based language applications**. The end goal is to prototype SoC-level language interface blocks that can be used for multilingual voice or handwritten input for devices like smart assistants, translation engines, etc.

## 🔍 Project Scope

The project explores:
- Speech pre-processing (MFCC extraction)
- OCR for Indian scripts (e.g., Kannada, Hindi)
- Language detection
- FPGA/VLSI hardware mapping of components
- Verilog/VHDL/High-Level Synthesis (HLS) mapping
- Embedded ML optimizations
